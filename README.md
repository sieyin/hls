# Simple HLS Player

A simple front built around [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) to stream video URLS[^1] on the web as easy as possible.

You can see it at work here → [https://sieyin.github.io/hls/](https://sieyin.github.io/hls/).

*<small>[^1]: you can [try this stream URL](https://sieyin.github.io/hls/?stream=https://live-hls-v3-aje.getaj.net/AJE-V3/index.m3u8) as an example →  https://live-hls-v3-aje.getaj.net/AJE-V3/index.m3u8*</small>
